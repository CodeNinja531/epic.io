EPIC THE MUSICAL
**The Troy Saga
*The Horse and the Infant
[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Alright my brothers listen closely
Tonight we make the Trojans pay
Ten years of war they killed us slowly
But now we'll be the ones who slay
Think of your wives and your children
Your families wonder where you've been
They're growing old and yet you're still here
Do what I say and you'll see them again
Yes sir!
Diomedes will lead the charge
Agamemnon will flank the guards
Meneleus will let our mates through the gates to takе the whole city at large
Tеucer will shoot any ambush attack
And Little Ajax will stay back
Nestor, secure Helen and protect her
Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector!
Yes sir!
Find that inner strength now
Use that well of pride
Fight though every pain now
Ask yourself inside
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?

[SOLDIERS]
What do you live for?
What do you try for?
What do you wish for?
What do you fight for?

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Penelope...
Penelope...
And Telemachus
I fight for us, I fight for us
What do you live for?       - Penelope
What do you try for?        - Telemachus
What do you wish for?       - I'm on my way
What do you fight for?      - Attack!
Who was that?

[ZEUS]
A vision of what is to come
Cannot be outrun
Can only be dealt with right here and now

[ODYSSEUS]
Tell me how

[ZEUS]
I don't think you're ready
A mission to kill someone's son
A foe who won't run
Unlike anyone you have faced before

[ODYSSEUS]
Say no more, I know that I'm ready
[ZEUS]
I don't think you're ready

[ODYSSEUS]
It's just an infant...
It's just a boy...
What sort of imminent threat does he pose that I can not avoid?

[ZEUS, ENSEMBLE]
This is the son of none other than Troy's very own prince Hector
Know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger
One fueled with rage as you're consumed by age
If you don't end him now you'll have no one left to save
You can say goodbye to
Penelope, you can say goodbye to Penelope

[ODYSSEUS, ZEUS]
I could raise him as my own (He will burn your house and throne)
Or send him far away from home (He'll find you wherever you go)
Make sure his past is never known (The gods will make him know)
I'd rather bleed for ya, down on my knees for ya (He's bringing you down on your knees for ya)
I'm begging please Oh, this is the will of the gods
Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this

[ZEUS]
The blood on your hands is something you won't lose
[ALL]
All you can choose is whose

*Just a Man
[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
I look into your eyes and I
Think back to the son of mine
You're as old as he was when I left for war
Will these actions haunt my days
Every man I’ve slain?
Is the price I pay endless pain?
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
How could I hurt you?
I'm just a man who's trying to go home
Even after all the years away from what I’ve known
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
Deep down I would trade the world to see my son and wife
I'm just a man
But when does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze?
Whеn does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
When does a man become a monster? Forgive me
I'm just a man

*Full Speed Ahead
[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Six hundred men, six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
Make it back alive to our homeland
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
It's what lies in between
And Ithaca's waiting Ithaca's waiting
My kingdom is waiting The kingdom is waiting
Penelope's waiting for me
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead
[EURYLOCHUS, SOLDIERS]
Captain, Eurylochus
Six hundred men Six hundred men
Six hundred men with big mouths to feed, and we've run out of supplies to eat
Curse the war, our food store's depleted
Six hundred men Six hundred men
Six hundred reasons to take what we can
So captain, what's the plan?
Captain, what's the plan?
[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Watch where the birds fly
Watch where the birds fly
They will lead us to land
They will lead us to land
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead
[EURYLOCHUS & SOLDIERS]
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
[POLITES]
Captain
[ODYSSEUS]
Polites!
[POLITES]
Look! There in the distance, I see an island
I see a light that faintly glows
Maybe they're people lighting a fire
Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?
[ODYSSEUS]
Something feels off here
I see fire but there's no smoke
[EURYLOCHUS]
I say we strike first, we don't have time to waste
So let's raid the place and-
[ODYSSEUS]
No
Polites gear up, you and I'll go ahead
[POLITES]
You and I'll go ahead
[ODYSSEUS, EURYLOCHUS]
We should try to find a way no one ends up dead
We don't know what's ahead
[ODYSSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ALL]
Give me til sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Full speed ahead
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and a-
Full speed ahead

*Open Arms
[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend
[ODYSSEUS]
Huh?
[POLITES]
I can tell you're getting nervous
So do yourself a service
And try to relax my friend
[ODYSSEUS]
I'm fine, Polites
[POLITES]
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into
I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You could show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
Give it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
[LOTUS EATERS]
Welcome!
[ODYSSEUS]
Stay back!
[LOTUS EATERS]
Stay back!
[POLITES]
My friend, greet the world with open arms
[ODYSSEUS]
We're only here for food
[LOTUS EATERS]
Food
[ODYSSEUS]
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces
[LOTUS EATERS]
Food
[ODYSSEUS]
Stay back, I'm warning you
If we don't get back safely, my men will turn this place into blazes
[LOTUS EATERS]
Here you go
[POLITES]
See? This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
[ODYSSEUS]
My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms
[POLITES]
Lotus eaters, I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?
[LOTUS EATERS]
The cave
[POLITES]
A cave! You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?
[LOTUS EATERS]
East, that way!
[POLITES]
Thank you!
[LOTUS EATERS]
Welcome!
[POLITES]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms
[ODYSSEUS]
Greet the world with open arms
[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend

*Warrior of the Mind
[ATHENA]
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?

[ODYSSEUS:]
Athena!

[ATHENA]
Have you forgotten to turn off your heart? This is not you
I see you changing from how I've designed you
Have you forgotten your purpose? Let me remind you
Goddess of wisdom, master of war
My life has one mission, create the greatest warrior

I had a challenge, a test of skill
A magic boar only the best could kill
One day a boy came for the thrill
A boy whose mind rivalled the boar's own will

[ODYSSEUS:]
Let's go!

[ATHENA]
Maybe one day he'll follow me
And we'll make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
I know he'll change the world
'Cause he is a warrior of the mind
Maybe one day I'll reach him
And we can build his skills as I teach him
If there's a problem, he'll have the answer
He is a warrior of the mind

[ODYSSEUS:]
Show yourself
I know you're watching me
Show yourself
I can see you

[ATHENA]
How can you see through my spell?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken:]
Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff
Hahahaha

[ATHENA]
Well done, enlighten me, what's your name?

[ODYSSEUS:]
You first, and maybe I'll do the same

[ATHENA]
Nice try, but two can play this game

[ODYSSEUS (ENSEMBLE):]
Nah, don't be modest
I know you're a goddess
So let's be honest

You are Athena (Athena)
Badass in the arena
Unmatched, witty (and queen of)
The best strategies we've seen

[ATHENA]
If you're looking for a mentor, I'll make sure your time's well spent

[ODYSSEUS:]
Sounds like a plan
Goddess and man
Bestest of friends

[ATHENA]
We'll see where it ends

[ODYSSEUS:]
Okay

[ATHENA]
Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll

[BOTH:]
Make a greater tomorrow, then they'll see
I know we'll change the world
'Cause we are the warriors of the mind
Maybe one day we'll reach them
And we can build their skills as we teach them
If there's a problem, we'll have the answer
We are the warriors of the mind

[ATHENA]
I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind
Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind
You are a warrior of the mind
Don't disappoint me

**The Cyclops Saga

*Polyphemus
Over here
Look at all this food!
Look at all these sheep!
I can't believe this cave has all this for us to keep!
I've gotta hand it to you both
This is quite the treat
There are enough sheep here to
Feed the entire fleet
It's almost too perfect
Too good to be true
Why would the lotus eaters pass up on all this food?
Who are you?
Hey there!
We're just travelers
We come in peace
You killed my sheep
My favorite sheep
What gives you the right to deal a pain so deep?
Don't you know that pain you sow is pain you reap?
Time to drink your blood over where you stand
Your life now is in my hand
Before I'm done
You will learn that it's not so fun to take
You came to my home to steal
But now you'll become my meal
A trade you see?
Take from you, like you took from me
There's been a misunderstanding
We never came here to steal
But now that I see we've done some damage
Maybe you and I can make a deal
I'll give you our finest treasure
So long as we leave alive
You can keep the world's best tasting wine
Wine?
Have a drink!
One sip and you'll understand
The power that's in your hands
A wine so fresh
You'd never wanna eat human flesh again
Then we shall be on our way
No bloodshed in here today
A trade you see?
A gift from you and a gift from me
Ahh
I'd like to thank you
Stranger, what's your name?
My name is Nobody, Nobody, Nobody
Nobody
For your gift I've one to reply
I'm so glad we see eye to eye
Yes
You shall be the final man to die
What
Watch out!

*Survive
[ENSEMBLE]
Po-ly-phe-mus
Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS]
My brothers
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
And if we're defeated, they’re good as dead
Straight ahead, that is who we're fighting

[ENSEMBLE]
Po-ly-phe-mus

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
No backup, no chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
No dying on me now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

Surround him, surround him
Attack from behind, keep distance in mind
And stay in his blindspot and strike his heels, strike the heels
Show him that we're deadly, ha, ha

Exhaust him, exhaust him
Don't let him get close, he's strong but he's slow
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach
Find a breach
Stand up and fight for your lives

[SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS ]
Six hundred lives at stake
It's just one life to take
And when we kill him then our journey’s over
Push forward
No dying on us now
Defeat is not allowed
We must live through this day so
Fight, fight, fight

~


[POLITES]
Captain…

[POLYPHEMUS]
Enough


[SOLDIER]
He’s got a club…
He's got a club!

[SOLDIER]
What are our orders?
Captain? Captain!

[POLYPHEMUS]
You’ve hurt me enough
Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break
And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed
You won’t live through this day now die
Die…

*Remember them
[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!

[ODYSSEUS]
We must move quickly, we don't have much time
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Mark my words now, this is not the end

[EURYLOCHUS]
But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?

[ODYSSEUS, ODYSSEUS & SOLDIERS ]
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain

[ODYSSEUS]
I need all our hands on his club
This is how we're getting out of here
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
And turn it to a giant spear

[SOLDIERS]
Let's kill him!

[ODYSSEUS]
His body is blocking the path
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain, where do we attack him?

[ODYSSEUS]
We gotta stab him in the eye

[SOLDIERS]
Yes sir
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
[ODYSSEUS]
Now!
Scatter!

[CYCLOPES]
Who hurts you?

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
There are more of them?

[CYCLOPES]
Who hurts you?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hide

[CYCLOPES]
Who hurts you?

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain, we should run

[ODYSSEUS]
Wait

[CYCLOPES]
Who hurts you?

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain, please

[ODYSSEUS]
Wait

[POLYPHEMUS]
It was Nobody, Nobody

[CYCLOPES]
If nobody hurts you, be silent

[POLYPHEMUS]
Don’t go!

[ODYSSEUS]
Let's grab the sheep and away we go

[ATHENA]
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
He's still a threat until he's dead
Finish it

[ODYSSEUS]
No

[ATHENA]
No?

[ODYSSEUS]
What good would killing do
When mercy is a skill more of this world could learn to use
My friend is dead, our foe is blind
The blood we shed, it never dries
Is this what it means to be a warrior of the mind?

[ATHENA]
Don't!

[ODYSSEUS]
Hey, Cyclops!
When we met, I led with peace
While you fed your inner beast
But my comrades will not die in vain

Remember them
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
Remember them
Remember us
Remember me

I'm the reigning king of Ithaca
I am neither man nor mythical
I am your darkest moment
I am the infamous
Odysseus

*My Goodbye
[ATHENA, ODYSSEUS]
You were reckless, sentimental at best
That's not a teaching of mine
You’ve grown soft, your dead friends can attest
Hey!
Put your emotions aside
You're a warrior meant to lead the rest
I don't know where I went wrong
But I warned ya’, and you failed the test
So now I'm gone

This way, you'll know what your place is
This way, you can't cross the line
This way, when all is over you'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
This way, you won't disappoint me
This way, you won't waste my time
This way, I’ll close the door
Consider this as my goodbye

[ODYSSEUS]
That’s just likе you, why should I be surprised?
Selfish and pridеful and vain
Unlike you, every time someone dies
I'm left to deal with the strain
What’s a title that a goddess could lend if I'll never sleep at night?
I'll remind you I saw you as a friend
But now we're done

This way, you’re out of my head now
This way, you won't plague my life
This way, when all is done, you're out of sight and out of mind
This way, you get what you wanted
This way, you can save your time
This way, you close the door and have your damn goodbye

[ATHENA]
You're not looking for a mentor
I'm not looking for a friend
I mistook you for a general
What a waste of effort spent

[ODYSSEUS]
At least I know what I'm fighting for
While you're fighting to be known
Since you claim you're so much wiser
Why's your life spent all alone?
You're alone

[ATHENA]
One day, you'll hear what I'm saying
One day, you might understand
One day, but not today, for after all you're

[ENSEMBLE]
Just a man

[ATHENA, ENSEMBLE ]
This day, you sever your own head
This day, you cut the line
This day, you lost it all
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye
Ohh
Consider this as my goodbye
Ohh
This is my goodbye

** The Ocean Saga
*Storm
[ODYSSEUS]
These waves and tides
Have grown in strength and size
Is it nature or divine
Or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight
This storm's our final fight
There's no time to die
Comrades?

[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Brace for a storm
Storm
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm
Storm
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be safе

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain, we will capsize with thesе waves, our fleet will fail

[ODYSSEUS]
Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
Storm
Storm

[EURYLOCHUS]
We're taking too much damage to survive

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
We'll beat this storm
Storm

[EURYLOCHUS]
At this rate, we won't make it out alive

[PERIMEDES/ELPENOR, spoken]
Captain, look!

[ODYSSEUS & EURYLOCHUS]
An island in the sky
[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus, grab the harpoons
As many as you can find

[EURYLOCHUS]
What do you have in mind?

[ODYSSEUS]
We're gonna shoot for the sky

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
What?

[SOLDIERS]
Storm, storm

[ODYSSEUS]
Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high

[SOLDIERS]
Storm, storm

[ODYSSEUS]
We're shooting for the island in the sky
In the sky
[SOLDIERS]
Storm, storm


*Luck Runs Out
[Eurylochus]
Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

You've heard the legends of the island in the sky
This proves they're true
We're in the home of the wind god

We don't know for sure

How many floating islands have you seen before?
This is the home of the wind god

And what's your plan?
I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand

You could be caught off guard and lose your life
Or piss off this god and infuse us with strife
Don't forget how dangerous the gods are

Have faith, friend, we've come this far

Yes, but how much longer 'til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

I still believe in goodness
I still believe that we could be kind
Lead from the heart, and see what starts

And what will we do when it tears us apart?

Where is this coming from, my friend?

I just don't wanna see another life end

You're like the brother I could never do without

And suddenly, you doubt that I could figure this out?

Captain, how much longer 'til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?
How much longer 'til your great days cease?
How much longer 'til your strength takes leave?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

Thank you for the concern, but brother, I can assure you
Our journey is almost done
I understand that we're tired, I understand that we're fazed
But don't forget how much we've already faced
I took 600 men to war and not one of them died there
In case you needed a reminder
If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then
I need to talk to you in private

I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
I can't have you disagreeing each route
I need you to always be devout and comply with this
Or we'll all die in this
Okay?

Okay

Thank you

*Keep Your Friends Close
[ODYSSEUS]
Great Wind God Aeolus
I don't know if you know this
But our path to home is blocked by an impenetrable storm
I ask for your assistance
So we at last can go the distance
Can you cast the perfect wind for us and aid our journey home?

[AEOLUS]
Ha ha ha
I am the wind, twisting and turning
I give the fire enough to stay burning
Let's play a game

[ODYSSUS]
A game?

[AEOLUS]
That's what I'm serving
And if you win, you will get what you're yearning

[ODYSSEUS]
Deal

[AEOLUS]
Take a look right here at this bag
It has the winds of the storm all trapped
All you gotta do is not open this bag

[ODYSSEUS]
Sounds too easy, what's the catch?

[AEOLUS, WINIONS]
Ha ha ha
Keep your friends close as your enemiеs closer
Never rеally know who you can trust
If they wanna get the bag open, you gotta say "no, sir"
Sometimes killing is a must

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[AEOLUS]
Cause the end always justify the means
Friends turn into foes in rivalries
So keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust

[PERIMEDES/ELPENOR]
Captain! What's happening?
What's trapped in that bag?

[ODYSSEUS]
Something dangerous, friends!
We mustn't lag!

[WINIONS]
It's treasure!

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[WINIONS]
Buh-bye!

[PERIMEDES/ELEPNOR]
Open the bag!
Let's see what you got!

[ODYSSEUS]
No, do not!
Everybody listen closely
See how the bag is closed?
That's how it's supposed to be
This bag has the storm inside!
We cannot let the treasure rumor fly!

[PERIMEDES/ELEPNOR]
We'll try!

[AEOLUS, CREW & WINIONS]
Keep your friends and your enemies closer!
Never really know who you can trust!
Now you wanna get the bag open so they can have closure!
Sometimes, sneaking is a must!
Cause the end always justifies the means!
Everything's changed since Polites, so!
Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!
Never really know who you can trust!

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
For nine days, I've stayed wide awake
Tryna make it home with no storm or tidal wave
I remain unopposed, the bag is still closed
And I'm getting closer to you...
Penelope
I can't wait to make some new memories...
Telemachus
Time for me to be the father I never was

[ODYSSEUS, PENELOPE & TELEMACHUS]
Just keep your eyes open
Why are my eyes and my heart and my soul so heavy
Just keep your eyes open
I keep on trying to embrace you both, why won't you let me
Just keep your eyes open
So much has changed, but I'm the same, yes I'm the same
'Just keep your eyes open

[SOLDIERS]
Keep your eyes open

[PENELOPE]
Wake up!
Wake up, Odysseus, they're opening the bag
Wake up!

[ODYSSEUS]
No!

[AEOLUS, WINIONS, CREW]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Never really know who you can trust
Never really know who you can trust
Storm
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Where's the storm taking us?

[AEOLUS]
I said to keep the bag closed, but you weren't compliant
If I had to guess? You're heading to the

[AEOLUS & WINIONS]
Land of the giants

[CREW]
Storm, storm

[ODYSSEUS]
Help me close the bag!

[EURYLOCHUS]
But sir, it's too late

[ODYSSEUS]
We can save whatever wind is left to use another day
Come on!

[POSEIDON]
Odysseus of Ithaca!
Do you know who I am?

*Ruthlessness
[LAESTRYGONIANS]
Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Poseidon

[POSEIDON]
In all my years of living
It isn't very often that I get pissed off
I try to chill with the waves
But damn, you crossed the line

I've been so gracious
And yet, you hurt the son of mine
That's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
No

[POSEIDON, LAESTRYGONIANS]
I'm left without a choice
And without a doubt
Guess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now
I've gotta make you bleed
I need to see you drown
But before you go, I need to make you learn how

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlеssness is mercy upon ourselvеs
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves

You are the worst kind of good
'Cause you're not even great
A Greek who reeks of false righteousness
That's what I hate

'Cause you fight to save lives
But won't kill and don't get the job done
I mean you totally could have avoided all this
Had you just killed my son
But no

You are far too nice
Mercy has a price
It's the final crack, we're about to break the ice now
You reveal your name
Then you let him live
Unlike you I've got no mercy left to give 'cause

Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Ourselves
And now it is finally time
To say goodbye
Today, you die
Unless, of course, you apologize
For my son's pain
And all his cries

[ODYSSEUS]
Poseidon, we meant no harm
We only hurt him to disarm him
We took no pleasure in his pain
We only wanted to escape

[POSEIDON]
The line between naïveté and
Hopefulness is almost invisible
So close your heart
The world is dark and

[LAESTRYGONIANS]
Ruthlessness is mercy-

[POSEIDON]
Die

[LAESTRYGONIANS, SOLDIERS]
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain) mercy upon our- Captain
Ruthlessness is (Captain)
[ODYSSEUS]
What have you done?

[ENSEMBLE]
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?

[POSEIDON]
Forty three left under your command

[ENSEMBLE]
When does a man become a monster?

[POSEIDON]
I am your darkest moment
The monster that always draws near
Any last words?

[ODYSSEUS]
All I gotta do is open this bag

[POSEIDON]
What?
Remember me

**The Circe Saga
*Puppeteer
Captain, I have something that I must confess
Something that I must get off my chest
Until it is said, I cannot rest

Captain?
Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure
But captain
There's only so much left we can endure
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
Of that, I'm sure
Okay
Eurylochus, back so soon?
Where's the rest of your crew?
And by the gods, what happened to you?
We came across a palace
Inside we heard a voice
It seemed to show no malice
To greet it was our choice
But nothing could prepare us for thе power that awaited inside
What did this palacе hide?
Sir, since we left home we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist
But this was a hell of a twist, cause we are weak to a power like this
What was it?
A woman
What?
She had us in just two words
Come inside
Damn
Welcome to the best part of your lives
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in
Take a seat
Let me bring you all something to eat
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet
I got you, don't worry Circe's got you now
By the time they ate, it was far too late
For inside the meal (Think of your past)
She had cast a spell (And your mistakes)
They began to squeal (They'll be the last)
And grow snouts and tails (Mistakes you'll make)
She changed them
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
They transformed (This is the price)
And it wasn't quick (We pay to live)
She turned our men (The world does not)
From men to pigs (Tend to forgive)
She changed them
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
We have to go save them
No we don't
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned
Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned
Think about the men we have left before there's none
Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run
Of course I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
I can only hope you'd do the same
I can hear her still (No one will find)
And her voice deceives (Their way between)
What if she can't be killed? (My nymphs and I)
Will you choose to leave? (Their loving queen)
I don't know
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
She's a clever witch (This is the price)
And she's hard to slay (We pay to love)
It's a game of wits (We draw the line)
But you don't have to play (Watch from above)
I have to try
I got all the power, yeah, I got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

*Wouldn’t You Like
[HERMES]
I must say what a brilliant speech you gave

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Who goes there?

[HERMES]
Just a friend who could help you save your men
A foe like Circe is not to be messed with
You want to beat her?
You'll need the blessing of a certain god
Divine intervention
Someone who's not afraid to send a message

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes?

[HERMES]
Hahahahaha
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to havе some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcomе preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
She can turn you into an animal that'll end up on her plate
She can all but make you fall in love like you're on your hundredth date
She can conjure up a monster that'll grind you to the bones
She has all the ways to haunt ya when you take her on alone

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her
Oh

[HERMES]
Here in the root of this flower
There lies such a power to take her on
You must consume and digest it
Then you'll manifest a being of your creation
All you need's imagination
Though it's only for a moment
Till you've beaten your opponent

[HERMES, spoken]
And I call this root: Holy Moly

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Ah
[HERMES]
Hahahahahaha!

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE]
Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

[HERMES & ENSEMBLE, ODYSSEUS]
(Oh) Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
(Oh) Deep in the night the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
(Oh) Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
(Oh) Deep in the night the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes
Thank you

[HERMES]
Don't thank me friend
You very well may die
Haha, good luck

*Done For
Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this
But I hope that I've been misinformed
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through here
And they wound up at your doors
Through the years, we seldom get a warm welcome
So I must ask just to be sure
Did you do something to them?

Who, me?
All I did was reveal their true forms
You turned them into pigs
Huh

I don't know who you are, nor why you're here
But let me make this one thing clear
I've got people to protect
Nymphs I can't neglect
So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you make one wrong move, then you're done for
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for
I could put a spell on you, and you're done for
Boy, you better run, or soon you will be done for

I don't mean to tip your scale but
You will fail at placing any spells on me
I just ate a flower, one that claims your power
So you better cower now and flee

You must be a liar
Mortals can't acquire
Moly without dire consequence
Then I must be a god like you
'Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands
Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?
Okay, fine, yes, but regardless

You and I are now evenly matched
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached
I've got people to protect
Friends I can't neglect
So now, there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Not even a spell saves you, 'cause you're done for
Oh, you better run, or soon you will be done for

You've lost
My nymphs are like my daughters
I protect them at all costs
The last time we let strangers live
We faced a heavy loss
You've given me no reason to bestow you with my trust
But everyone's true colors are revealed in acts of lust
I'm not sure I follow

*There Are Other Ways
There are other ways of persuasion
There are other modes of control
There are other means of deceit
There are other roads to the soul
There are other options of passion
You have so much left to learn
Want to save your men from the fire?
Show me that you're willing to burn, woah
Oh, well, who's to say, with all the mistakes I've made
(Don't be afraid)
That they will be the last (think of your past)
Mistakes I ever make? (Don't break when)
There is so much power
So much power
But there's no puppets here
This is the price (I'm just a man) we pay for love
There is the line (I'm just a man) never enough
So much power
So much power (forgive me)
But there's no puppet here
I can't
Back at home, my wife awaits for me
She's my everything, my Penelope
And she's all my power, all my power
But it's been 12 long years
Oh, 12 long years since I have seen my wife
And now the God of Tides is out to end my life
So I beg you, Circe, grant us mercy
And let us puppets leave
Ah, Posiedon, eh?
There might be a way to evade him
There might be a way to get home
Though this other way's very dangerous
It might be your one final hope
I know of a brilliant prophet
Problem is this prophet is dead
I can't get you home, but I'll get you to the Underworld instead
I'll release your men, and I'll get you to the Underworld instead
Wait, you're helping us?
There are many ways of persuasion
There are many modes of control
Maybe showing one act of kindness
Leads to kinder souls down the road
I remember actions of passion
I have been in love once before
Maybe one day, the world will need a puppeteer no more
Or maybe one day, the world will need a puppeteer more
[Crew]
(So much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here
No, she's not a player, she's a puppeteer
No, she's not a player, she's a puppeteer, yeah)

**The Underworld Saga
*The Underworld
[ODYSSEUS]
Friends, Circe's instructions were clear
No matter what we hear

[ALL]
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Until we find the prophet
My comrades, this land confuses your mind
So no matter who we find

[ALL]
Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Good

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
And here in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind

[FALLEN SOLDIERS]
When does a man become a monster?
558 men who died under your command
Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!
Why would you let the cyclops live
When ruthlessness is mercy?

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS]
All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
But in The Underworld, the past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night

[POLITES]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

[Odysseus, spoken]
Polites

[POLITES]
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

Even if you're the last thing I see, I'll be waiting
I'm right here, mom
Can't you see? I'm
Waiting

[BOTH]

[ODYSSEUS, ANTICLEA]
I took too long
I'll always love you
And ventured too far
I'll stay in your heart
While you were

Bye mom

[ODYSSEUS, SOLDIERS, ALL]
All I hear are screams
All I hear are screams
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream
I no longer dream
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
But in The Underworld, your past is always close behind
Your past is always close behind
Down in The Underworld

*No Longer You
[TIRESIAS]
I am the prophet with the answers you seek
Time, I've unlocked it
I see past and future running free
There is a world where I help you get home
But that's not a world I know

[ODYSSEUS]
What?

[TIRESIAS]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayals
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you


[ODYSSEUS]
This can't be
We've suffered and sailed through the toughest of hells
Now you tell us our effort's for nothing?

[TIRESIAS]
I see your palace covered in rеd
Faces of men who had long beliеved you're dead
I see your wife with a man who is haunting
A man with a trail of bodies

[ODYSSEUS]
Who?

[TIRESIAS]
I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayals
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you

*Monster
[ODYSSEUS]
How has everything been turned against us?
How did suffering become so endless?
How am I to reunite with my estranged?
Do I need to change?

I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost
I'm the only whose line I haven't crossed
What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea
Is me?

What if I'm the monster?
What if I'm in the wrong?
What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?
What if I'm the one who killed you
Every time I caved to guilt?
What if I've been far too kind to foes
But a monster to ourselves?
What if I'm the monster

Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?
Is he up in the middle of the night?
Or does he end my men to avenge his friend
And then sleep knowing he has done him right?

When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
Is she going insane?
Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain?
When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown
Is he scared that he's doing something wrong?
Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him
And now no one dares to piss him off?
Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans cause he is vile?
Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile

If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away
Would that make us stronger?
Would it keep our foes at bay?
If I became the monster to everyone but us
And made sure we got home again
Who would care if we're unjust?
If I became the

[SOLDIERS]
Monster

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

[SOLDIERS]
Monster

[ODYSSEUS]
And deep down I know this well
I lost my best friend
I lost my mentor, my mom
500 men gone, this can't go on
I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus
So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches
I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us
And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall
In an instant so we all don't die

[ODYSSEUS, ALL]
Then I'll become the
Monster
I will deal the blow
And I'll become the
Monster
Like none they've ever known
So what if I'm the
Monster
Lurking deep below?
I must become the
Monster
And then we'll make it home

Monster
Penelope
Monster
Telemachus
Monster
Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
Monster
I'll become the monster

[Siren as Penelope]
Don’t you miss me?

[Odysseus]
More than you know

[Siren as Penelope]
Then jump in the water and kiss me

[Odysseus]
Penelope, I’ve told you this before
You know I’m afraid of the water

[Siren disguised as Penelope]
I’ll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let’s watch our love leave the ground

[Odysseus]
Oh, I would
But I’d be suffering trying to float the whole time

[Siren disguised as Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, as good as it sounds, right here I’m just finе

[Siren as Penelope]
I could take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You know that I prеfer my feet on the ground

[Siren as Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

[Siren as Penelope]
Of course!

[Odysseus]
Okay, so let’s say I was on the run or hiding…
From I don’t know Poseidon…
And let’s say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

[Siren as Penelope]
Oh no!

[Odysseus]
How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

[Siren as Penelope]
He will chase you high and low
So find a place he’ll never go
The one where you get home
It’s sailing where he scared to roam
It’s through the lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
No...

[Siren as Penelope]
This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

[Odysseus]
But Scylla has a cost

[Siren as Penelope]
Well, you asked and now you know
Now jump in the water!

[Odysseus]
Penelope, why?
You know I’m too shy and terrified

[Siren as Penelope]
I would take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Oh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

[Siren as Penelope]
I could take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time

[Siren as Penelope]
I will take the suffering from you

[Odysseus]
Ah, the things I do for you

*Different Beast
[ODYSSEUS]
Let's cut this charade, you are no wife of mine
You've been tryna take my life this whole time
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Yeah, I know exactly what you are: a siren
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched

[SIREN]
What?!

[ODYSSEUS & SOLDIERS]
We are a different beast now
We are the ones who feast now
No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
First we slayed in our own war
And now, we're here with more foes
While on the run from Poseidon
We found a ship with no crew
I realised nearby, there were sirens
Singing sailors to their dooms
We filled our ears with beeswax
That's how we resist your song
You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along
I read your lips and phrases
Scanning for information
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Now I know how to get back to my island

[SOLDIERS]
We are a different beast now
We are the ones who feast now
No more of us decease, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters
We are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer
We won't take more suffering from you

[SIRENS]
Spare us
Oh, spare us please

[ODYSSEUS]
Why?
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
I made a mistake like this and almost cost my life
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
Throw their bodies back in the water
Let them drown

[SIRENS]
No!

[SOLDIERS]
He is a different beast now
He is the one who feasts now
No more of us decease, 'cause he won't take more suffering from you
He is the man-made monster
He is the one who conquers
You are a threat no longer
He won't take more suffering from you

[ODYSSEUS]
Kill them all!

Oh, woah-oh-oh, oh woah-oh-oh, oh, woah-oh-oh

We must do what it takes to survive

We are the same, you and I, I

*Mutiny
[EURYLOCHUS]
Tell you did not know that would happen
Say you didn't know how that would end
Look me in the eyes and tell me, Captain
That you did not just sacrifice six men?
Use your wits to try and say I'm crazy and mad
That this is all some trick the gods have sent
Tell me you did not miss home so painfully bad
That you gave up the lives of six of our friends?

When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan
And when we fought with Circe, it was you who left behind no man
But when we fought this monster, we didn't take a stand
We just ran
Say something

[ODYSSEUS]
I can't

[EURYLOCHUS]
Then you have forcеd my hand

[SOLDIERS]
Eurylochus

[ODYSSEUS]
Lower your weapon

[EURYLOCHUS]
No can do
You miss your wife so bad you tradе the lives of your own crew

[ODYSSEUS]
Don't make me fight you, brother, you know you'd have done the same

[EURYLOCHUS]
If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame

[SOLDIERS]
Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
There is no price he won't pay

[ODYSSEUS]
I am not letting you get in my way
My brothers, why?

[SOLDIERS]
How are we supposed to trust you now?
Now your time has come, your luck's run out
Now, the time has come to shut you down
You relied on wit and then we died on it
Woah-oh-oh
[ODYSSEUS]
Agh, my head!
Where are we?

[EURYLOCHUS]
Some island, the first one we found
It's bursting with cows just roaming around
Begging us to eat, so much meat
And hunger is so heavy
This statue
The God of the Sun
Don't know where it's from
But here's where we found all these cows to hunt
Right in front
And hunger is so heavy

[SOLDIERS]
Hunger is so heavy

[ODYSSEUS]
Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

[EURYLOCHUS]
Ody, we're never gonna get to make it home
You know it's true
[ODYSSEUS]
You don't know that's true
This is the home of the Sun God

[EURYLOCHUS]
I'm starving my friend

[ODYSSEUS]
But if you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send?
This is the home of the Sun God

[EURYLOCHUS]
I'm tired, my friend

[ODYSSEUS]
But we're so close to home, this can't be where it ends

[EURYLOCHUS & ODYSSEUS]
How much longer must I suffer?
Please don't do this
How much longer must I push through doubt?
I need to get home
How much longer must we go about
Eurylochus
My life like this when people die like this?
Woah

[EURYLOCHUS & SOLDIERS, ODYSSEUS]
How much longer must we suffer now?
Reconsider
How much longer must we push through doubt?
We can get home
How much longer must we go about
Eurylochus
Our lives like this when people die like this?
Woah

[EURYLOCHUS]
I'm just a man

[ODYSSEUS]
Eurylochus no!

You've doomed us
You've doomed us all, Eurylochus!

[EURYLOCHUS]
Captain?

[ODYSSEUS]
We need to get away from this island now!
Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow
These cows were immortal, they were the Sun God's friends
And now that we've pissed them off, who do you think he'll send?

[SOLDIERS]
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Faster!

[SOLDIERS]
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
Faster!

[SOLDIERS]
Full speed ahead

[ODYSSEUS]
We're too late

*Thunder Bringer
[ZEUS]
Pride is a damsel in distress
Hiding away where only I can undress her
Try all she can not to confess
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure
Thunder, bring her through the wringer,
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her,
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed
Tell me, Odysseus
If I were to make you choose
The lives of your men and crew or your own
Why do I think they'd lose?
Enlighten me, King of Ithaca
Since hunger was far too great
I wonder who'd take the weight of the damned
And suffer a gruesome fate to the
Thunder Bringer, here to ring your
Ears until you're deaf with fear and
Spear you while your death is near
Lighting wielder, here to yield your
Time for you have passed your prime
Sublime you for your act of crime

[ZEUS, spoken]
Choose.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Choose?

[ZEUS]
Someone's got to die today
And you have got the final say
You?
Or your crew?

[ODYSSEUS]
Please don't make me do this
Don't make me do this

[SOLDIERS]
When does a comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze?

[PENELOPE]
I can take the suffering from you

[SOLDIERS]
When does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?

[PENELOPE]
Let me take the suffering from…

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
...Captain?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I have to see her.

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
...But we'll die.

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...I know.

[ZEUS]
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgment call
The one who makes her kingdom fall
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her
Show her what she can't conceal
For true nature will be revealed

**The Wisdom Saga
*Legendary
[TELEMACHUS]
It's just me, myself, and I
Stuck in my bedroom, living in this world you left behind
Dreaming of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight
But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring this world some light
Cause I'm stuck with your stories
But no clue who you are
And no idea if you're dead or just too far
Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign
If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?
If so, then
Give me sirens and a cyclops!
Give me giants and a hydra!
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary!
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras!
The minotaurs, even Cerberus!
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary
There are strangers in our halls
Trying to win the heart of my mom
But she is standing tall
108 old faces of men who call me small
They keep taking space and it's not much longer we can stall
Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too
And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you
Somebody help me, come and give me the strength
Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?
If so, then
Give me sirens and a cyclops!
Give me giants and a hydra!
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary!
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras!
The minotaurs, even Cerberus!
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary

*Little Wolf
[ANTINOUS, SUITORS]
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

[ANTINOUS]
You've made your worst mistake here
Might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break
When you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons
Your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents
Just for being good, so

[ANTINOUS, SUITORS]
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain mе?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Lеt's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then

[ANTINOUS & SUITORS]
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight
Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or fly, little wolf, fly?
All because you had to try, little wolf, try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die

[ATHENA, spoken]
Need some help?

[TELEMACHUS]
What's goin' on here?

[ATHENA]
Is your plan to stand around?
'Cause I suggest you fight back

[TELEMACHUS]
I don't know how

[ATHENA, spoken]
Uppercut him, now

[TELEMACHUS]
Woah, how did I do that?
Is time now moving slow?

[ATHENA]
No, I just made your thoughts quick

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Woah, that is so sick

[ATHENA, spoken]
Alright now, let's try this again

[ATHENA]
I've no respect for bullies
Those who impose their will
I've seen plenty enough
To truly understand this kind of filth
Let's teach this dog a lesson
In front of all his kind
One young wolf has a larger heart
Than all these men combined

[ATHENA, ATHENA & SUITORS]
Fight, little wolf, fight
Show them that you've got some
Bite, little wolf, bite
Take advantage now and
Strike, little wolf, strike
Don't go down without a
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf
Get up and fight

[SUITORS, ATHENA]
Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain us? (Oh)
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this (Strike)
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then (Oh, fight)
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

[ATHENA, spoken]
Oh, maybe I pushed you a bit too hard

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Ow

[ANTINOUS]
Go back and cry in your corner
Make sure your mother hears
If she won't choose a man to adorn her
We'll bring blood and tears

[TELEMACHUS]
Tell me, Athena, why you came to my aid

*We'll be Fine
[ATHENA]
I had a friend before, and
He was a lot like you
I helped him fight through war, but
He had his demons too
And then we grew apart
Then his light went dark

And so, I thought
Maybe, if I made a different call
Maybe if I hadn't missed it all
Maybe, he'd be fine
Maybe we'd unwind
Maybe, if I help another soul
Maybe, if I helped you reach your goal
Life could be that bright
I could sleep at night

[TELEMACHUS]
Athena, I don't know who your friend is
I don't know what he's like, but
My time with you has been splendid
The best day of my life
Cause I got in a fight, and I didn't die

I've never felt strong before
You're my friend, I couldn't ask for more
And so, I think

Maybe, if life wasn't spent as planned
Maybe, it's time that you lend a hand
I don't think he'll mind
If not his friend, then mine

[TELEMACHUS & ATHENA]
Maybe, to fall is to learn one way
Maybe, it's all gonna turn out great
I know we'll be fine
I know it's light you'll find

[ATHENA]
You're a good kid

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Thanks!

*Love in Paradise
[ATHENA]
Old friend, it's been ten years since I last saw you

[ODYSSEUS]
Remember me, I am the infamous Odysseus

[SOLDIERS]
Oh, woah, woah, woah

[ATHENA]
Let's see where you've been

[AEOLUS]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

[POSEIDON]
Ruthlessness is mercy upon oursel—

[CIRCE]
One wrong move and you're done for, anything I—

[TIRESIAS]
Song of past romance, I see the—

[CREW]
We won't take more suffering from you

[SCYLLA]
Drown in your sorrow and fears

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
Captain?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I have to see her

[EURYLOCHUS, spoken]
But we'll die

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I know

[ATHENA, spoken]
Odysseus, where did you go?

[CALYPSO]
Morning sleepyhead
You've been resting for a while
I swore that you were dead
When you washed up on my isle
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?

[ODYSSEUS]
She's my wife

[CALYPSO]
Anyways, I've got all you could want here
All you could need here
Just you and me, my dear my love for life
Soon into bed we'll climb and spend our time

[ODYSSEUS]
I'm not your man

[CALYPSO]
I'm what you want here
I'm what you need here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Now til the end of time
From here on out, you're mine, all mine

[ODYSSEUS]
Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm no pet, I'm a married man

[CALYPSO]
Oh handsome, you may try
But last I checked, goddesses can't die

[ODYSSEUS]
Goddess?

[CALYPSO]
You're adorable
Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
But fear not, I bring no pain
Cause we've got
All we could want here
All we could need here
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown

[ODYSSEUS]
No, no
I don't belong here
There's something wrong here
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Not till the end of time, there is no way

[CALYPSO]
You're mine, all mine

[ATHENA]
Seven years, she's kept you trapped, out of your control
Time can take a heavy toll

[CALYPSO]
Odysseus?

[ODYSSEUS]
All I hear are screams

[CALYPSO]
Ody, get away from the ledge

[ODYSSEUS]
You don't know what I've gone through
You don't know what I've sacrificed
Every comrade I long knew
Every friend, I saw them die
And all I hear are screams

[CALYPSO]
It will be fine, dear
Come back inside, dear
Love of my life, come back to paradise

[ODYSSEUS]
Let me close my eyes

[CALYPSO]
I know your life's been hard
I'll stay inside your heart

[ODYSSEUS]
All I hear are screams

[CALYPSO, ODYSSEUS]
I love you, my dear
I love our time here
Life would be so much worse
(Just let me close my eyes)
If you had died
Please stay away from harm
Stay in my open arms
(All I hear are)

[POLITES, EURYLOCHUS, ANTICLEA, ODYSSEUS]
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
How much longer till your luck runs out?
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
How much longer till the show goes south?
(Oh)
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
How much longer till we all fall down?
(Oh)
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Greet the world with open arms, greet the world with open arms

[ODYSSEUS]
Athena!

[ATHENA]
He needs my help


*God Games
[ATHENA]
Father, God King
Rarely do I ask for favors
Now, I'm knocking on your door
With hopes to save a friendship with one who's a prisoner far from home
Odysseus

[ZEUS]
Divine intervention, is that what you seek?
To untie apprehensions that were placed on that Greek?
You are playing with thunder for a man full of shame
But if he's worth the risk of going under, why not make it a game?
Convince each of them that he ought to be released, and I'll release him

[ATHENA]  
Who's them?

[ZEUS]  
Apollo, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Ares, Hera, or me
What do you say?

[APOLLO]
Great

[HEPHAESTUS]
Very well

[APHRODITE]
Eh

[ARES]
Alright

[HERA]
Groovy

[ATHENA]
Bring it

[ENSEMBLE]
Apollo!

[APOLLO]
You all know I'm a fan of catchy songs
So with so many sirens gone, I think Ody's in the wrong

[ATHENA]
They were trying to do him worse
All he did was reimburse them
Now they'll tread with caution first
To live another day and sing another verse

[APOLLO]
If that's true, release him

[ENSEMBLE]
Hephaestus!

[HEPHAESTUS]
Trust is not given, it's forged
Why should I give him my support?
He sacrificed his own cohort

[ATHENA]
Did you forget they failed to listen?
He was betrayed and then imprisoned
But if you make the right decision
He can still build a future with those who miss him
 
[HEPHAESTUS]
Fine, release him

[ENSEMBLE]
Aphrodite

[APHRODITE]
Your little high and mighty Odysseus
Claims to love his mother
But let her die of a broken heart

[ATHENA]
He was busy fighting

[APHRODITE]
More like busy spiting the cyclops
Let him feel the pain that his mother felt and rot

[ATHENA]
Wait, please reconsider this

[ARES]
Really Athena? These old tricks?

[ATHENA]
Ares!

[ENSEMBLE]
Ares, Ares

[ARES]
What kind of sick coward
Holds back his power
While his friends get devoured?
He didn't even fight Scylla
Didn't even try to kill her
Hides inside a wooden horse to get the job done
Never handles things upfront
Pathetic and weak like his son

[ATHENA]
Hold your tongue now
His son's my friend
And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend
You want more bloodshed?
Then set him free
To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed

[APHRODITE & ARES]
Ugh, release him

[HERA]
Hey baby

[ENSEMBLE]
Hera!

[HERA]
So many heroes
So many tales
Give me one good reason why yours should prevail

[ATHENA]
He’s got the mind of a genius

[HERA]
Try harder

[ATHENA]
He’s pretty skilled with words

[HERA]
You can do better than that

[ATHENA]
He’s kind of funny?

[HERA]
Eh

[ATHENA]
Never once has he cheated on his wife

[HERA]
Release him

[ATHENA]
I've played your game and won
Release him

[ZEUS]
You dare to defy me?
To make me feel shame?
No one beats me, no one wins my game!

[ZEUS & ENSEMBLE]
Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgement call
The one who makes her kingdom fall!

[ARES]  
Is she dead?
[ATHENA]
Let him go, please
Let him go

**The Vengeance Saga
*Not Sorry for Loving You
[CALYPSO]
Someone arrived today
They said they're taking you away
That you're not mine to save
And soon I won't get to see your face
So I came by to say
You're unlike anyone I have ever known
Cause you're all I've ever known
And if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
But I'm not sorry for loving you

[ENSEMBLE]
I'm not sorry for loving you

[CALYPSO]
I'm not sorry for loving you

[ENSEMBLE]
I'm not sorry for loving you

[ODYSSEUS]
Calypso

[CALYPSO]
Let me speak
I spent my whole life here
Was cast away when I was young
Alone for a hundred years
I had no friends but the sky and sun
So when you washed ashore
I thought for sure that you were my dream come true
I thought I knew
So if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
But I'm not sorry for loving you
[ENSEMBLE]
I'm not sorry for loving you

[CALYPSO]
I'm not sorry for loving you
[ENSEMBLE]
I'm not sorry for loving you

[CALYPSO]
I'm not sorry
I'm angry and tired and restless and sad
I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had
I wish you would chase me
Or try to embrace me
For once, I wish you would lie and say

[ODYSSEUS]
I love you

[CALYPSO]
You do?

[ODYSSEUS]
But not in the way that you want me to

[CALYPSO]
I hate that I fell in love with you
[ENSEMBLE]
Hate that I fell in love with you

[CALYPSO]
Why did I fall in love with you?
[ENSEMBLE]
Why did I fall in love with you?

[CALYPSO]
What do I do with this love for you?
[ENSEMBLE]
What do I do with this love for you?

[CALYPSO]
How am I supposed to get over you?
[ENSEMBLE]
How am I supposed to get over you?

[CALYPSO]
Why in the world won't you love me too?

*Dangerous
[ODYSSEUS]
Six hundred men
Six hundred deaths under my command
'Cause I had one goal in mind
No fleet, no band
Only this raft that I made by hand
How will I reach my homeland?

[HERMES]
All you have to do is not open this bag

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes?

[HERMES, spoken]
Ahahahahaha, hello old friend

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
So you're the one who talked to Calypso?
Why are you here?

[HERMES]
You're being given a final option
Consider this your one last chance
To make it back home and abandon caution
Wash it away like the blood your hands have known
I know if you dance with fate
Then I know, I know you'll enhance your state

[ODYSSEUS]
If your plan's so great then why'd you wait to say it?

[HERMES]
Well it's a little bit dangerous, my friend
You'll need a mindset change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
And put your wholе brain in it
Remember еvery trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
Be dangerous

[ODYSSEUS]
Alright, I'm in, what do I do?

[HERMES]
First stop, uncharted waters
When lost, look towards the sky
Follow the north star, no matter how far
You think you're going, you keep on rowing
When strangers lurk around the isle
When danger greets you with a smile
Fight your way through, do what you must do
No matter what, keep moving
It's gonna be dangerous, my friend
You'll need a mindset change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
And put your whole brain in it
Remember every trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home?
Put it all on the line
Be dangerous

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Hermes
Thank you

[HERMES]
Don't thank me, friend
I'm not the one who fought for you

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Then who?

[HERMES, spoken]
Ha-ha, good luck

*Charybdis
[ODYSSEUS]
You must be who Hermes mentioned
A monster here to block my way
I'd like to hurry up and end this
So if you don't have much to say
Then oh, bring it on
I'm not dying here, I'm still fighting here
I'm holding on
Til I see it through, til I've beaten you
I already know your tactics
When you swallow you attack with
whirlpools that attract prey
But I see a disadvantage,
cause I don't even have to kill you
I'll just have to avoid you
See, if you don't spit it out soon,
all that water will destroy you
Oh, bring it on
Til you're out of breath, til there's nothing left
I'm holding on
Til I'm in the clear, til I'm out of here, oh—

[CHARYBDIS roars, waves crash]

[ODYSSEUS]
There, I see it
The island I'vе been searching for
Home, I've rеached it
My wife and son are past these shores
Holding on
I am almost there, my love, don't be scared
Hold on
I am on my way, I'll be there today
Penelope
[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
What?
No, no!


*Get in the water
[POSEIDON]
There you are, coward

[POSEIDON]
I've been waiting for this moment
For the perfect time to strike
When your home's so close
And you've reached your coast
That's when our paths collide
I've got a reputation
I've got a name to uphold
So I can't go letting you walk or
else the world forgets I'm cold
Now get in the water
Get in the water
Or I'll raise the tide so high,
all of Ithaca will die
Get in the water

[ODYSSEUS]
Wait
[POSEIDON]
Get in the water
[ODYSSEUS]
Stop this, please
[POSEIDON]
I'll make tidal waves so profound
Both your wife and your son will drown
[ODYSSEUS]
NO!

[POSEIDON]
Get in the water!
Get in the water!
Don't mistake my threats for bluff
You have lived more than enough
Get in the water!
Get in the water!
I'll take your son and gouge his eyes
That is, unless you choose to die
Get in the water!

[ODYSSEUS]
Aren't you tired, Poseidon?
It's been eight years
How long will this go?
We're both hurting from losses
So why not leave this here
And just go home?

[POSEIDON, spoken]
I can’t

[ODYSSEUS]
Maybe you could learn to forgive

[POSEIDON]
No
Ruthlessness is
Mercy upon
Ourselves
Die

[POLITES]
You can relax, my friend
I can tell you’re getting nervous

*Six Hundred Strike
[ENSEMBLE]
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred

[ODYSSEUS]
I don't think you seem to get it,
I can't afford to die,
'Cause I will get back to my son,
And I will get back to my WIFE!!!

[ODYSSEUS]
For every comrade!
Every one of my friends!
Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand!
SIX HUNDRED STRIKE!!

[ENSEMBLE]
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred men, six hundred
Six hundred, six hundred men

[POSEIDON, spoken]
You idiot...

[POSEIDON]
Can't you see?
You sealed your fate just to beat me.
You released my storm when you opened that bag
Blocked your one way home

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Now, you'll never get back!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
You're going to call off that storm...

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Or what?
You can't kill me!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
Exactly...

[ODYSSEUS picks up POSEIDON's Trident]

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Wait...
WAIT!!!
AH!!!
UGH!

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE HELPLESS?! (ARGH!!)
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW PAIN?! (UGH!!)
I WATCHED MY FRIENDS DIE IN HORROR! (AH!!)
CRYING AS THEY WERE ALL SLAIN! (UGH!)
I HEARD THEIR FINAL MOMENTS! (ARGH!)
CALLING THEIR CAPTAIN IN VAIN! (UGH!)
LOOK WHAT YOU TURNED ME INTO! (AH!!)
LOOK WHAT WE'VE BECOME! (UGH!)

[POSEIDON, spoken]
Enough…

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
ALL OF THE PAIN THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH! (Stop!)
HAVEN'T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?! (STOP!!!)

[ODYSSEUS]
YOU DIDN'T STOP WHEN I BEGGED YOU!!!
TOLD ME TO CLOSE MY HEART!!!

[POSEIDON, spoken]
You...

[ODYSSEUS, POSEIDON]
YOU SAID THE WORLD WAS DARK!!! (MONSTER!!!)

[ODYSSEUS]
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT RUTHLESSNESS IS MERCY UPON OUR-

[POSEIDON]
ALRIGHT!!!
Please...

[ODYSSEUS drops POSEIDON's Trident]

[POSEIDON, spoken]
After everything you've done...
...how will you sleep at night?!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...Next to my wife.

**The Ithaca Saga
*The Challenge
[PENELOPE]
I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown
I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud
They don't know that every night
I unthread all the work I've done
'Cause I'd rather lie
Than allow them to think they've won
Though I never thought that I'd resort to this
Just know I'll be here

But I don't know how much longer I'll last
Since we saw that storm
And though it was so close to our kingdom
It was far from the norm

[PENELOPE, spoken]
Unless...

[PENELOPE]
Oh, could it be some kind of sign
That my world is all about to change?
Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?
Though I never thought that it would come to this
Just know I'll be here, buying you time

[SUITORS]
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house (Penelope)

[PENELOPE]
Oh, buying you time

[SUITORS]
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house

[PENELOPE]
Whoever can string my husband's old bow
And shoot through twelve axes cleanly
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne
And rule with me as his queen

Let the arrow fly
Once you know that your aim is true
'Cause I'd rather die
Than grow old without the best of you
Though I never thought
That these would be the lengths we go for love
I would not have it any other way

And though I never thought that it would end like this
Just know I'll be here
Waiting, waiting

[SUITORS]
Penelope

[PENELOPE]
Waiting, waiting

[SUITORS]
Penelope

[PENELOPE]
Waiting, waiting
Oh

*Hold Them Down
[SUITORS]
Whoever can string the old king's bow
And shoot through twelve axes cleanly
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne
Penelope as his queen
Where is he?
Where is the man who can string this bow? Woah...

[ANTINOUS]
Screw this competition, we've been here for hours
None of us can string this, we don't have the power
Screw this damn challenge, no more delays
Can't you guys see we're being played?
This is how they

[ANTINOUS SUITORS, ALL]
Hold us down while the throne gets colder
Hold us down while we slowly age
Hold us down while the boy gets bolder
Where in the hell is our pride and our rage?!
Here and now, there's a chance for action
Here and now, we can take control
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul

[ANTINOUS]
Haven't you noticed who's missing?
Don't you know the prince is not around
I heard he's on a diplomatic mission
And I heard today he comes back to town, so
I say we gather near the beaches
I say we wait 'til he arrives
Then, when he docks his ship, we can breach it
Let us leave now, today we can strike and

[ANTINOUS, SUITORS, ALL]
Hold him down 'til the boy stops shaking
Hold him down while I slit his throat
Hold him down while I slowly break his pride, his trust, his faith, and his bones
Cut him down into tiny pieces
Throw him down in the great below
When the crown wonders where the prince is
Only the ocean and I will know

[ANTINOUS]
And when the deed is done
The queen will have no one to
Stop us from breaking her bedroom door
Stop us from taking her love and more

[ANTINOUS, SUITORS, ALL]
And then we'll
Hold her down while her gate is open
Hold her down while I get a taste
Hold her down while we share her spoils
I will not let any part go to waste
Here and now, there's a chance for action (Chance for action!)
Here and now, we can take control (Take control!)
Here and now, burn it down to ashes
Channel the fire inside your soul and

Hold them down, hold them down (Hold them down! Oh!)
Hold them down, hold them down
Hold them down, hold them down (Hold them down!)
Channel the fire inside your soul, and-! (Hold them down, hold them down)

[ANTINOUS suddenly gets shot in the throat and dies]


*Odysseus (song)
[ODYSSEUS]
For twenty years I've suffered every punishment and pain
From the wrath of gods and monsters
To the screams of comrades slain
I come back and find my palace desecrated, sacked like Troy
Worst of all, I hear you dare to touch my wife and hurt my boy!

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
I... have had.... enough...

[ENSEMBLE (slowly)]

Ody-

[SUITOR #1]
In the heat of battle at the edge of the unknown

[SUITOR #2]
Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile, deadly foe

[SUITOR #3]
We have the advantage. We've the numbers and the might

[SUITOR #4]
No! You don't understand it;
this man plans for every fight

[An arrow strikes the last SUITOR, killing him.]

[ENSEMBLE]
Ody-sseus

Ody-sseus

[SUITOR #5]
Where is he?
WHERE IS HE?!

[SUITOR #6]
Keep your head down
He's aiming for the torches

[SUITOR #7]
Our weapons, they're missing

[SUITOR #8]
He's using the darkness to hide his approaches

[SUITOR #9]
We're empty-handed
Up against an archer
Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness

[SUITOR #10]
We know these halls
The odds can be tilted!

[ODYSSEUS]
You don't think I know my own palace?
I BUILT IT!

[ODYSSEUS slaughters all six SUITORS]

[ENSEMBLE]

[EURYMACHUS]
Old king, our leader is dead
You've destroyed the serpent's head
Now the rest of us are no longer a threat
Old king, forgive us instead
So that no more blood is shed
Let's have open arms instea-

[ODYSSEUS shoots EURYMACHUS]

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
No.

[AMPHINOMUS]
Damn, he's more cunning than I assumed
While we were busy plotting, he hid our weapons inside this room

[MELANTHIUS]
I find it hard to believe that the sharpest of kings
Left his armory unlocked

[AMPHINOMUS]
So what?
Now that we have armed ourselves
Let's make the bastard rot

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Behind you!

[TELEMACHUS]
Throw down those weapons
And I'll ensure you'll be spared

[MELANTHIUS]
After seeing what the king will do to us
We wouldn't dare

[TELEMACHUS]
I don't want to hurt you
But trust me, I've come prepared

[MELANTHIUS]
Ha! Your very presence has doomed the king, young prince
We don't fight fair

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Stop!

[MELANTHIUS]
Brothers, we have company, and he's made a grave mistake
Left the weapons room unlocked, and now they're ours to take
Brothers, come and arm yourselves
There's a chance for us to win
We can still defeat the king if we all attack the prince!

[SUITORS]
Where is he? Where is he?

[MELANTHIUS]
Capture him, he's our greatest chance!

[TELEMACHUS]
Get off me! Get off me!

[MELANTHIUS]
Fight 'til the prince can barely stand

[SUITORS]
Hold him down! Hold him down!

[MELANTHIUS]
Make the king obey our command

[SUITORS]
Hold him down! Hold him down!

[MELANTHIUS]
'Cause if he won't, I'll break the kid's hands

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Got him!

[ODYSSEUS stabs MELANTHIUS]

[MELANTHIUS, spoken]
Mer...mer...

[ODYSSEUS]
Mercy? MERCY?!
My mercy has long since drowned
It died to bring me home
And as long as you're around
My family's fate is left unknown
You plotted to kill my son...
You planned to RAPE MY WIFE!
ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!!

[ENSEMBLE]
Odysseus

[ODYSSEUS]
You filled my heart with hate
All of you who've done me wrong
THIS WILL BE YOUR FATE!

[ODYSSEUS beheads MELANTHIUS' corpse.]

[ENSEMBLE, (slowly)]
O-dy-sse-us

[The remaining SUITORS scream in terror as ODYSSEUS kills them all]

[ENSEMBLE, (slowly)]
O-dy-sse-us

*I Can’t Help but Wonder
[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Father?

[ODYSSEUS, spoken]
...Son!

[TELEMACHUS]
All my life, I'd have died to meet you
Thought about your name so much it hurts
For twenty years, I'd dreamt of how I'd greet you
Oh, and now you're here
I can't find the words

All my life I'd have died to know you
Days and nights I wish that I could show you
For twenty years I never could outgrow you
Oh, and now you're here

I can't help but wonder
What your world must be
If we're like each other
If I have your strength in me
All this time I've wondered
If you'd embrace me as your own
Twenty years I've wandered
For so long I've felt alone

[ODYSSEUS]
Oh my son, look how much you've grown
Oh my boy, the sweetest joy I've known
Twenty years ago I held you in my arms
How time has flown, oh

Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you
Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you
Held you in my arms prepared to die for you, oh
How time has flown

I can only wonder
What your world has been
Things you've had to suffer
And the strength you hold within
All I've ever wanted
Was to reunite with my own
Twenty years we've wandered
But today you're not alone

My son, I'm finally home!

[ENSEMBLE]
Home, home

[TELEMACHUS]
Father, how I've longed to see you!

[ENSEMBLE]
Home, home

[ODYSSEUS, TELEMACHUS]
Telemachus, I'm home (Home)

[ODYSSEUS]
Go, tell your mother I'm home
I'll be there in a moment

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Of course

[ODYSSEUS]
Show yourself
I know you're watching me
Show yourself
You were never one for hellos

[ATHENA]
I can't help but wonder
What this world could be
If we all held each other with a bit more empathy
I can't help but feel like
I led you astray
What if there's a world where we don't have to live this way?

[ODYSSEUS]
If that world exists
It's far away from here
It's one I'll have to miss
For it's far beyond my years
You might live forever
So you can make it be
But I've got one endeavor
There's a girl I have to see

[ATHENA, spoken]
Very well...

[TELEMACHUS, spoken]
Father? She's waiting for you!

*Would You Fall in Love with Me Again
[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope...

[PENELOPE]
Is it you? Have my prayers been answered?
Is it really you standing there?
Or am I dreaming once more?
You look different
Your eyes look tired
Your frame is lighter
Your smile, torn
Is it really you, my love?

[ODYSSEUS]
I am not the man you fell in love with
I am not the man you once adored
I am not your kind and gentle husband
And I am not the love you knew before

Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I cannot change
Would you love me all the same?
I know that you've been waiting
Waiting, for love

[PENELOPE]
What kinds of things did you do?

[ODYSSEUS]
Left a trail of red on every island
As I traded friends like objects I could use
Hurt more lives than I can count on my hands
But all of that was to bring me back to you

So tell me
Would you fall in love with me again
If you knew all I've done?
The things I can't undo
I am not the man you knew
I know that you've been waiting, waiting-

[PENELOPE]
If that's true, could you do me a favor?
Just a moment of labor, that could bring me some peace?
See that wedding bed?
Could you carry it over?
Lift it high on your shoulders
And take it far away from here?

[ODYSSEUS]
How could you say this?
I had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat
Carved it into the olive tree where we first met
A symbol of my love everlasting
Do you realize what you have asked me?
The only way to move it is to it cut from its roots!

[PENELOPE]
Only my husband knew that
So I guess that makes him you!

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope...

[PENELOPE]
I will fall in love with you
Over and over again
I don’t care how, where, or when
No matter how long it’s been
You’re mine
Don’t tell me you’re not the same person
You’re always my husband
And I’ve been waiting, waiting

[ODYSSEUS]
Penelope!

[PENELOPE, ODYSSEUS]
Waiting, waiting (Penelope)
Waiting, waiting
Waiting, oh!
For you...


[PENELOPE]
How long has it been?

[ODYSSEUS]
Twenty years

[PENELOPE & ODYSSEUS]
I-I love you...

** ILIUM (?)
*Fire
Never shall I gaze upon a blazing Troy
Never would I yield to such a fate
Tell me what you saw beyond that hazy void
The one your gift of prophecy creates

Ilium, Ilium, Ilium, ahh
Ilium, Ilium, Ilium, ahh
